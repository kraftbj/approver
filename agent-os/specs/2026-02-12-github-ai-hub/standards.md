# Applicable Standards

## global/coding-style

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Establish and follow naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files across the codebase
- **Automated Formatting**: Maintain consistent code style (indenting, line breaks, etc.)
- **Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names that reveal intent; avoid abbreviations and single-letter variables except in narrow contexts
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task for better readability and testability
- **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) and configure your editor/linter to enforce it
- **Remove Dead Code**: Delete unused code, commented-out blocks, and imports rather than leaving them as clutter
- **Backward compatibility only when required:** Unless specifically instructed otherwise, assume you do not need to write additional code logic to handle backward compatibility.
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid duplication by extracting common logic into reusable functions or modules

## global/error-handling

- **User-Friendly Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages to users without exposing technical details or security information
- **Fail Fast and Explicitly**: Validate input and check preconditions early; fail with clear error messages rather than allowing invalid state
- **Specific Exception Types**: Use specific exception/error types rather than generic ones to enable targeted handling
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Handle errors at appropriate boundaries (controllers, API layers) rather than scattering try-catch blocks everywhere
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to degrade gracefully when non-critical services fail rather than breaking entirely
- **Retry Strategies**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures in external service calls
- **Clean Up Resources**: Always clean up resources (file handles, connections) in finally blocks or equivalent mechanisms

## testing/test-writing

- **Write Minimal Tests During Development**: Do NOT write tests for every change or intermediate step. Focus on completing the feature implementation first, then add strategic tests only at logical completion points
- **Test Only Core User Flows**: Write tests exclusively for critical paths and primary user workflows. Skip writing tests for non-critical utilities and secondary workflows until if/when you're instructed to do so.
- **Defer Edge Case Testing**: Do NOT test edge cases, error states, or validation logic unless they are business-critical. These can be addressed in dedicated testing phases, not during feature development.
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus tests on what the code does, not how it does it, to reduce brittleness
- **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive names that explain what's being tested and the expected outcome
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate units by mocking databases, APIs, file systems, and other external services
- **Fast Execution**: Keep unit tests fast (milliseconds) so developers run them frequently during development

## global/conventions

- **Consistent Project Structure**: Organize files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README files with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
- **Version Control Best Practices**: Use clear commit messages, feature branches, and meaningful pull/merge requests with descriptions
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration; never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimal; document why major dependencies are used
- **Code Review Process**: Establish a consistent code review process with clear expectations for reviewers and authors
- **Testing Requirements**: Define what level of testing is required before merging (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for incomplete features rather than long-lived feature branches
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Keep a changelog or release notes to track significant changes and improvements
